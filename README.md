# Social-Network-API



Your Challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Youâ€™ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.


 Ensure that the mongoose package is using version 6+. The latest version of mongoose (version 7+) introduces potential breaking changes to activities. All activities have version 6.9.2 in their respective package.json files, but should you install mongoose, please use npm i mongoose@6.9.2.
